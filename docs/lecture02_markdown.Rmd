# What is RMarkdown? 
<img src="images/markdown.png" style="width:150px; position:absolute; top:7%; left:45%" /> 

* RMarkdown: `R` + `markdown`
* `markdown` contrasts `markup` languages (e.g. HTML) which require syntax that can be quite difficult to decipher for the uninitiated
* RMarkdown is a framework that provides a literate programming format for data science.
* **Literate programming**: programmers add narrative context with code to produce documentation for the program simultaneously.
* **Reproducible research**: the whole process (collecting data, performing analysis, producing output,...) can be reproduced the same way by someone else.

# What is RMarkdown? 

> In a nutshell, R Markdown stands on the shoulders of knitr and Pandoc. The former executes the computer code embedded in Markdown, and converts R Markdown to Markdown. The latter renders Markdown to the output format you want (such as PDF, HTML, Word, and so on).

# Create a RMarkdown document

Within RStudio, click `File` → `New File` → `R Markdown`.

# Important features of `markdown`

* Three aspect: YAML metadata, text, code chunks

---
# Important features of `markdown`
## 1. YAML Ain't Markup Language

* Head of the document where options are defined.
* Surrounded by `---`
* Options comprises: author, date, output format, table of content, themes, code folding, ...

---
# Important features of `markdown`
## 2. Text

* Core body, essential for explaining your analysis. 
* Markdown syntax comprises:  
  * emphasis (*&ast;italics&ast;*, **&ast;&ast;bold&ast;&ast;**, or &grave;`code style`&grave;)  
  * headers (# ## ###)
  * lists (* - + for unnumbered and 1. for numbered)   
  * hyperlinks (<> ()[])
  * blockquotes (>)
  * picture/gif ( !()[])
  * tables (usually better to use `knitr::kable()`)
  
---
# Important features of `markdown`
## 2. Text
* $\LaTeX$ in RMarkdown using the syntax `$math expression$`
* Cross-referencing sections using syntax `\@ref(label)`
* Citations and bibliographies can automatically be generated with RMarkdown
* **You can always use HTML**

# Important features of `RMarkdown`
## 3. Code Chunks 

Code chunks are specific to `RMarkdown`. It allows to embed `R` code within your document.

To insert these chunks within your RMarkdown file, use either:
- the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + I (OS X: Cmd + Option + I)
- the Add Chunk command in the editor toolbar
- by typing the chunk delimiters ` ```{r label, some option}` and ` ``` `   

---
# Important features of `RMarkdown`
## 3. Code Chunks 
Most common chunk options: 

- `eval`: (TRUE; logical) whether to evaluate the code chunk;
- `echo`: (TRUE; logical or numeric) whether to include R source code in the output file;
- `warning`: (TRUE; logical) whether to preserve warnings (produced by warning()) in the output like we run R code in a terminal (if FALSE, all warnings will be printed in the console instead of the output document);
- `cache`: (FALSE; logical) whether to "*cache*" a code chunk. It may be convenient to avoid re-running the computations and save time.
- `dependson`: (label) allows to refer to objects in other chunk.

# Important features of `RMarkdown`
## 3. Code Chunks 
Plot figure options: 

- `fig.path`: ('figure/'; character) prefix to be used for figure filenames (fig.path and chunk labels are concatenated to make filenames);
- `fig.show`: ('asis'; character) how to show/arrange the plots;
- `fig.width`, `fig.height`: (both are 7; numeric) width and height of the plot, to be used in the graphics device (in inches) and have to be numeric;
- `fig.align`: ('default'; character) alignment of figures in the output document (possible values are left, right and center;
- `fig.cap`: (NULL; character) figure caption to be used in a figure environment.

# Printing an output as a table with `knitr::kable()`
```{r, fig.height=5}
data("iris")
knitr::kable(iris[1:5,])
```

There are many more options that can be set to have particularly good looking table with the `knitr` and `kableExtra` packages ([click here for a detailled documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/kable.html)).

---
# Extended table options with `knitr::kable()` and `kableExtra`
```{r, fig.height=4}
library(kableExtra)
mtcars[1:3, 1:8] %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_paper(full_width = F) %>%
  column_spec(2, color = spec_color(mtcars$mpg[1:3]),
              link = "https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/") %>%
  column_spec(6, color = "white",
              background = spec_color(mtcars$drat[1:3], end = 0.7),
              popover = paste("am:", mtcars$am[1:3]))

# From RMarkdown to Quarto
<img src="images/quarto.png" style="width:250px; position:absolute; top:9%; left:55%" /> 
- Similar to RMarkdown, it can render docs that contain code in R, Python, Julia,... 
- It combines functionalities of RMarkdown and other packages into a **single system**, very useful to collaborate with people who write in a different programming language from you (and do not necessarily have R/R Studio).

> Like R Markdown, Quarto uses Knitr to execute R code, and is therefore able to render most existing Rmd files without modification.

# In-class exercise (10 minutes)
Basic manipulations:
1. Create a RMarkdown HTML document in `RStudio` and "`knit`" it.
1. Create a new header of type 2.
1. Make a linear regression with "Sepal Length" as a response and 
"Sepal Width" as an explanatory variable from the `iris` dataset and save the result. 
1. Highlight the code with `monochrome` style.
1. Print the summary of the linear regression.
1. Include the QQplot from the linear regression. Change to filled dots.
1. Print the head of the `iris` dataset with `kable`.
1. Remove the `.` from the labels (click [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/kable.html#change-column-names)).

---
# In-class exercise (10 minutes)
More advanced manipulations:
1. Install `kableExtra`. And perform the examples shown in the slides with `iris` dataset.
1. Using Mathpix, reproduce equation (6.1) of the paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0303109](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0303109)
1. Add the Reference and cite it in the RMarkdown.
1. Recreate your RMarkdown into a Quarto document.
