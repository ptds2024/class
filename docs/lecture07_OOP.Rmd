# ''Everything is a function call''
- A function has three components: **arguments**, a **body** and an **environment**.
- Signalling conditions: **errors** (sever problem), **warnings** (mild problem), **messages** (informative).
- Lexical scoping: how to find a value associated with a name (**dynamic lookup** and **name masking**).
- Environments (**current**, **global**, **empty**, **execution**,  **package**).
- Function composition through **nesting** or **piping**.

# S3 OOP system
* Object-oriented programming (OOP) is one of the most popular programming paradigm. 
* The type of an object is a **class** and a function implemented for a specific class is a **method**.
* It is mostly used for **polymorphism**: the function interface is separated from its implementation. In other words, the function behaves differently according to the class.
* This is related to the idea of **encapsulation**: the object interface is separated from its internal structure. In other words, the user doesn't need to worry about details of an object. Encapsulation avoids spaghetti code (see [Toyota 2013 case](http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/index2.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usna.edu%2FAcResearch%2F_files%2Fdocuments%2FNASEC%2F2016%2FCYBER%2520-%2520Toyota%2520Unintended%2520Acceleration.pdf)).
* `R` has several OOP systems: S3, S4, R6, ...
* S3 OOP system is the first R OOP system, it is rather informal (easy to modify) and widespread.

# Example of polymorphism
```{r}
summary(cars$speed)
summary(lm(cars$speed~cars$dist))
```

---
What is happening?
```{r}
sloop::s3_dispatch(summary(cars$speed))
sloop::s3_dispatch(summary(lm(cars$speed~cars$dist)))
```

* `*` indicates the method is defined;
* `=>` indicates the method is used.

```{r}
class(cars$speed)
class(lm(cars$speed~cars$dist))
```

---
What is happening?
```{r}
summary
head(summary.default)
head(summary.lm)
```

---
# `...`
* Using `...` is a special argument which allows to pass any number of additional arguments.
* You can catch it into a list:
```{r}
f <- function(...){list(...)}
f(a=1, b=2)
```
* It is useful for example when defining a **generic** method.
* The role of a generic is to **dispatch**: find the specific method for a **class**.

---
* A generic is easy to create
```{r}
my_new_generic <- function(x, ...) {
  UseMethod("my_new_generic")
}
```
* Then, you can create methods
```{r}
# default method
my_new_generic.default <- function(x, ...){
  print("this is default method")
}
# method for object of class `lm`
my_new_generic.lm <- function(x, ...){
  print("this is method for class `lm`")
}
```

```{r}
my_new_generic(cars$speed)
my_new_generic(lm(cars$speed~cars$dist))
```

---
* check the dispatch
```{r}
sloop::s3_dispatch(my_new_generic(cars$speed))
sloop::s3_dispatch(my_new_generic(lm(cars$speed~cars$dist)))
```
* Why are there several output when running `sloop::s3_dispatch(my_new_generic(cars$speed))`?

---
* check the dispatch
```{r}
sloop::s3_dispatch(my_new_generic(cars$speed))
sloop::s3_dispatch(my_new_generic(lm(cars$speed~cars$dist)))
```
* Why are there several output when running `sloop::s3_dispatch(my_new_generic(cars$speed))`?

```{r}
sloop::s3_class(cars$speed)
```
* `cars$speed` has class "numeric" and implicit class "double" (check `typeof(cars$speed)`).


---
# Inheritance
* An object can have several classes like a child has parents and ancestors. For example:
```{r}
class(glm(cars$speed~cars$dist))
```
* If a method is not found for the 1st class, then `R` looks for the 2nd class and so on.
```{r}
sloop::s3_dispatch(summary(glm(cars$speed~cars$dist)))
sloop::s3_dispatch(plot(glm(cars$speed~cars$dist)))
```

---
# Create your own S3 class
* S3 is rather informal and straightforward (be careful!)
```{r}
set.seed(123) # for reproducibility
image <- matrix(rgamma(100, shape = 2), 10, 10)
class(image) <- "pixel"
```

* `class` is a special attribute.
```{r}
attributes(image)
```

---
* Alternatively, it is neater to create a S3 object using `structure`
```{r}
set.seed(123) # for reproducibility
image <- structure(
  matrix(rgamma(100, shape = 2), 10, 10),
  class = "pixel"
)
```
* There is no method yet for this class
```{r,fig.align='center',fig.height=4,fig.width=4}
plot(image)
```

---

```{r}
sloop::s3_dispatch(plot(image))
plot
```

---
* Generally, it is a bad practice to create methods for a generic you don't own.
* But it is common for generics with `...` arguments such as `mean`, `sum`, `summary`, `plot`, `coefficients`, ...

```{r}
plot.pixel <- function (x, ...) {
  heatmap(x, ...)
}
sloop::s3_dispatch(plot(image))
```

---
* New plot for class `pixel`
```{r,fig.align='center',fig.height=6,fig.width=6}
plot(image)
```

---
* Thanks to `...`, you can pass other arguments (but be careful) (see for meaningful arguments `?heatmap`)

```{r,fig.align='center',fig.height=6,fig.width=6}
plot(image, col = cm.colors(256), xlab = "x axis", ylab = "y axis")
```

# To go further
* More details and examples in the book [An Introduction to Statistical Programming Methods with R](https://smac-group.github.io/ds/section-functions.html)
* More advanced remarks in [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html), Chapters 6, 7 and 8 for functions, Chapters 12 to 16 for object-oriented programming. More specifically, other OO paradigms (S4, R6) are presented.

# Exercises 
1. Create a `summary` function for the class `pixel`. Verify the dispatch before and after implementing the summary function.
2. Describe the difference between `t.test()` and `t.data.frame()`. What happens if you run the following code and why?
    ```{r, eval=F}
    x <- structure(1:10, class = "test")
    t(x)
    ```

---
<ol start="3"> 
<li>Read the documentation for <code class="remark-inline-code">UseMethod()</code> and explain why the following code returns the results that it does.</li></ol>
```{r, eval=F}
g <- function(x) {
  x <- 10
  y <- 10
  UseMethod("g")
}
g.default <- function(x) c(x = x, y = y)

x <- 1
y <- 1
g(y)
```
<ol start="4"><li> What do you expect this code to return? What does it actually return and why?</li></ol>
```{r, eval=F}
generic2 <- function(x) UseMethod("generic2")
generic2.a1 <- function(x) "a1"
generic2.a2 <- function(x) "a2"
generic2.b <- function(x) {
  class(x) <- "a1"
  NextMethod()
}

generic2(structure(list(), class = c("b", "a2")))
```
