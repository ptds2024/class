The project comprises
1. A well formatted and complete **R-package** with a **shiny app**:
  + Functions are documented with examples and tested.
  + The app can be called from one of the package function.
  + Data sets are placed in `data/` and wrangling steps in `data-raw/`.
  + The package passes all the checks (both locally and on GitHub).
  + There is at least one vignette showcasing the package/app.
  + The package can seamlessly be installed from the GitHub repo.
2. A well documented and well organized **GitHub repository**.
3. A `pkgdown` **website** showcasing your work and your package.

2. A well documented and well organized **GitHub repository**:
  + The repo must be on the organization `ptds2022`.
  + Edit the `README.md` to make the package as clear as possible.
  + Comprehensive commit messages and clear issues (closed once done).
  + Up-to-date GitHub projects that demonstrate your current organization for the project: TODOs, tasks in progress of resolution, tasks that have been completed.
  + Clean repo: do not add unnecessary files to the repo.
  + Put your presentation in a dedicated folder.
3. A `pkgdown` **website** showcasing your work and your package.
